Written for the convenience of me and my classmates in chemistry class.

This is a small calculator made for direct use. Not a library.
Written after much thinking.

If you need a library or a more *professional* solution for all
things chemistry, please use [chempy](https://github.com/bjodah/chempy).

The `chempy.util.stoich` module provides all things stoichiometry there.

> Stoichiometry word origin: early 19th century: from Greek stoikheion ‘element’ + -metry.
